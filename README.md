## 📢 The Mission
We are a collective of developers, designers, and thinkers building **sovereignty** for the Muslim world.

For too long, the Ummah has faced unique technical challenges—from financial privacy to ethical education—while relying on "black box" platforms that compromise our data or values.

We view this initiative as our digital **Jihad (striving)**—a relentless effort to build independent, privacy-first, and ethical technology that solves real problems for the community.

> **"And let there be [arising] from you a nation inviting to [all that is] good, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong..."**
> — *Quran (3:104)*

## 🚀 FEATURED RELEASE: RibaPurify (v1.0)

We have solved a major pain point for Muslims globally: **Purifying wealth from Interest.**

### [🛡️ RibaPurify](https://github.com/Code-for-Ummah/RibaPurify)
### Live Demo Link : ribapurify.vercel.app

**Status:** ✅ Live (Version 1.0)

Banks often force interest (Riba) onto accounts. Removing it requires tedious manual calculation, and existing online tools demand you upload sensitive statements to the cloud. **We changed that.**

* **Privacy First:** 100% On-Device. Your bank data never leaves your computer.
* **Automated:** Instantly detects and calculates Riba credits/debits.
* **Open Source:** Transparent code. No hidden agendas.

> **"Allah has permitted trade and has forbidden interest."**
> — *Quran (2:275)*
